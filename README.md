# Project_3 | Yelp API | Machine Learning Prediction
Data Analytics Final Project

- Goal: Predict Success of a restaurant based on category, area, and price.
- Assumption: Yelp Rating is the measure of success of restaurant.
- Technologies: Python Pandas - HTML/CSS/Bootstrap - JavaScript - Leaflet
- Idea: Making a prediction of the rating of restaurant using existing data from Yelp API.
- Machine Learning Technique: RandomForest

### Approach:
1. Gather restaurant information fom Yelp API for an entered city.
2. Store the results and clean them up.
3. Extract data for building a prediction model and a mapping dataset.
4. Split data into train and test datasets and fit it using RandomForest.
5. Verify accuracy of model and review predictions.
6. Filter mapping dataset to find similar restaurants (potential competitors) in the area.
